# Inline Evaluation

### Clojure

If you have some Clojure code in a file already, you can get going with inline eval by:

1. Create a new file and save it with a `.clj` extension or open a `.clj` file
2. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to evaluate a form
3. Wait for the client to connect (this can take a bit the first time)
4. Once connected you'll see your result.
