# Inline Evaluation

### Javascript/HTML/CSS

In order to evaluate Javascript, HTML, or CSS, we need a browser to see the result in. To open a browser tab in Light Table:

1. In the view menu click the `commands` item
2. Type "brows" and press enter when the `Browser: add browser tab` command is highlighted
3. Use the URL bar at the bottom to open your page. This can be a `file://` URL to open an HTML file locally, or it can be something on the network.

Now that we have a place to send our code, let's open a `.js` file and eval something:

4. Create a new file and save it with a `.js` extension or open a `.js` file
5. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Enter while the cursor is over a top-level block of code. To eval an inner block, select and then eval it.
5. Select the webpage name from the available clients popup
6. You'll now see results inline!
7. Evaling from a `.css` file will inject the CSS into the page.
8. Evaling from an `.html` file will refresh the browser tab.
